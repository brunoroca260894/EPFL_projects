# EPFL_projects
This folder contains some of the most relavant course projects on which I worked during my master's studies at EPFL.
In general, projects were coded using Python, C++ and MATLAB. Each project contains a file that describes what the project is about. 
Most of the projects contain a PDF report and codes too.
